    <h1>Spring 2023  &mdash; 41000 Graph Theory</h1>
</center>

    This course is about algorithms and analytical techniques to study networks, particularly
    random networks sampled from interesting generative models. The course assumes basic
    familiarity with directed and undirected graphs, the notions of connectivity and strong
    connectivity, and of BFS and DFS visits of graphs and their properties.
    
    <p>
    
    We will study applications of linear algebraic techniques to graphs, various results about
    spectral graph theory and spectral algorithms, and we will analyze spectral algorithms for
    community detection in the stochastic block model and to find planted cliques in random
    graphs.
