<p>Some examples of research projects</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Interactive proofs with &quot;efficient&quot; prover&nbsp; </b>
    <ul>
      <li>Consider the question of whether there can be an interactive proof for
        coNP where the prover can be implemented using a P^NP algorithm. Under
        what conditions can this be ruled out? It is related to the question of
        NP-complete problems having &quot;instance checkers&quot;,
        &quot;random-self-reducibilities&quot; and &quot;self-testers&quot;. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Algebraization</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Aaronson and Wigderson have proposed the notion of algebraization; one
      drawback of the definition is that a proof that A is contained in B and
      that B is contained in C can both algebraize without immediately implying
      that A contained in C algebraizes. Can this ever happen? (Is there some,
      possibly contrived example, where A contained in B and B contained in C
      algebraize, but A contained in C does not?) Is there an alternative notion
      of relativization that does not suffer from this problem but within which
      one can prove that IP=PSPACE, but not that P!=NP? 
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>Average-case complexity of Random 3SAT</b>
    <ul>
      <li>What kind of evidence can be found <i>against</i> random 3SAT being
        complete on average for NP? (Completeness against all samplable
        distribution under standard Levin-style reductions are easy to rule out,
        but what about more general reductions or more restricted classes of
        distributions?)</li>
    </ul>
