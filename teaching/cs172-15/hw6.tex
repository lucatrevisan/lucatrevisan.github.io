\subsection*{Problem 1: Unary Decidability (30)}

Let $\Sigma = \{1 \}$. Prove that there is an undecidable subset of $\Sigma^*$.

\subsection*{Problem 2: Recognizable-Decidable (30)}

Prove that a language $L$ is recognizable iff there exists a decidable language $D$ such that
$x \in L \Leftrightarrow \exists y: (x,y) \in D$.

\subsection*{Problem 3: Reductions Revisited (40)}

Let $A$ be a language that is neither empty nor $\Sigma^*$.
Consider the two sets of languages:

\begin{itemize}
  \item $L = \{ B \mid B \leq_m A \}$
  \item $U = \{ B \mid A \leq_m B \}$
\end{itemize}

\noindent Prove that $L$ is countable and $U$ is uncountable.
