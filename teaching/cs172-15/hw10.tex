\ptitle{Problem Set 10}{April 16, 2015}
This problem set is due on Friday, April 24, by 5pm. Please submit your solution online using bcourses,
as a pdf file.
You can type your solution, or handwrite it. If you handwrite it, then either
scan it or take a good resolution picture of each page and then collate the pictures
and export them to a {\em single} pdf file.
\\

\noindent You can use the fact that NL=coNL in your solutions.

\section*{Problem 1 (35/100)}
Consider the problem ShortestPath$= \{ (G,s,t,k) : \mbox { the shortest path  from }
s \mbox { to } t \mbox{ in } G \mbox{ has length exactly } k \}$ where $G=(V,E)$ is a directed graph, $s,t$ are vertices,and the length of a path is the number of edges in the path.
\\

\noindent Show that ShortestPath is NL-complete.

\section*{Problem 2 (35/100)}
Show that SPACE($n$) is not closed under polynomial-time reductions.  That is, when $A\leq^p_m B$ for languages $B\in$SPACE($n$) and some other language $A$, it may not be the case that $A\in$SPACE($n$) as well.
\\

\noindent [Note for contrast that P was closed under polynomial-time reductions since $A\leq^p_m B$ and $B\in$P, implies $A\in$P.]

\section*{Problem 3 (30/100)}
Show that NP $\neq$ SPACE($n^2$).
