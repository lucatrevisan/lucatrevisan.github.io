<h3>About the course</h3>

The mathematics of expander graphs is studied by three distinct
communities:

<ol>

<li> The algorithmic problem of finding a small balanced cut
in a graph (that is, of finding a certificate that a graph is *not* an
expander) is a fundamental problem in the area of approximation
algorithms, and good algorithms for it have many applications, from
doing image segmentation to driving divide-and-conquer procedures.

<li>
Explicit constructions of highly expanding graphs have many applications
in algorithms, data structures, derandomization and cryptography; many
constructions are algebraic, and lead to deep questions in group theory,
but certain new constructions are purely combinatorial.

<li> The speed of
convergence of MCMC (Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo) algorithms is related to
the expansion of certain exponentially big graphs, and so the analysis
of such algorithms hinges on the ability to bound the expansion of such
graphs.

</ol>

In this course we aim to present key results from these three areas, and
to explore the common mathematical background.

<p>

<b>Prerequisites:</b> undergraduate-level understanding of discrete probability, linear algebra, and 
algorithms; preferably, also a basic understanding of linear programming
and of duality.

<p>

<b>Assignments:</b> a midterm take-home exams and a take-home final exam.
Working on a  research project related to the topics of the class can
substitute for the final exam.
