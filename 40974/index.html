        <h1>Fall 2020 &mdash; 40974 Computer Science 2</h1>
        </center>
    
    This course is an introduction to algorithm design. Topics will include divide-and-conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming approaches to the design of algorithms for string processing problems, network optimization problems, and problems about cuts, flows and matchings in graphs. We will also cover the theory of NP-completeness.
