<h2>
<a NAME="Projects"></a>Projects</h2>
Each student taking the course for credit must select a final project.
The requirements for a project are to read papers
<br>related to a topic not covered (or not covered deeply) in class, and
to give a 25 minutes presentation. A written report is not required, but
may be submitted as part of the project. Presentations will be scheduled
in the week of May 15-18 (I will
<br>probably be out of town monday May 14), possibly concentrated between
May 16 and 17.
<p>Below is a list of possible topics for projects. If you have been particularly
interested in a topic that was only briefly developed in class, you are
encouraged to propose it as your project topic.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>
<li>
Relations between interactive proof models (Alison, Mark):</li>

<ul>
<li>
Transformation of general protocols into public-coin protocols (Goldwasser-Sipser)</li>

protocols (Vadhan)</li>

</ul>

<li>
Pseudorandom generators and one-way functions</li>

<ul>
<li>
Transformation of "regular" one-way functions into pseudorandom generators
(Goldreich-Krawczyk-Luby). In this case, it would be particularly good
to have a written report with explicit calculations of the relation between
the security of the construction and the security of the one-way function.</li>

<ul>
<li>

functions (Naor-Reingold)</li>

<li>
"Simple" analysis in Rubinfeld-Sudan</li>

<li>

<li>
(Optional) Reduction of the general case to the bivariate case (Arora-Safra
and ALMSS)</li>
</ul>

<li>
Hardness of approximation (Kunal)</li>

<ul>
<li>
Reductions from Hastad's verifier to Max CUT, Max 2SAT, etc. (Trevisan-Sorkin-Sudan-Williamson)</li>

<li>
Hardness of Set Cover (Feige)</li>
</ul>

One-sided error vs. two-sided error in randomized computations and combinatorial
constructions (Jordan)</li>

<li>
Simulation of randomized algorithms using a weak random source and a disperser
(Andreev-Clementi-Rolim-Trevisan)</li>

<li>
Deterministic simulation of BPP using deterministic simulation of promise-RP

<li>
Hardness for an exponentially small subset of the domain (Feige-Lund)</li>
</ul>

<li>
Error-correcting codes (Lawrence, Ranjit)</li>

<ul>
