<p>Luca Trevisan is 
a professor of computer science at Bocconi University, where he holds the Fondazione Invernizzi Chair in Computer Science.
Luca received his Dottorato (PhD) in 1997,
from the <i>Sapienza</i> University of Rome, working with Pierluigi Crescenzi.
After graduating, Luca was a post-doc at MIT and at DIMACS, and he was
on the faculty of Columbia University, U.C. Berkeley, and Stanford, before
returning to Berkeley in 2014 and, at long last, returning to Italy in 2019.


<p>Luca's research is in theoretical computer science, with a focus on computational complexity, on the analysis of algorithms,  on the foundations of cryptography, and on topics at the intersection of theoretical computer science and pure mathematics.</p>

<p>Luca is a <a href=https://awards.acm.org/fellows>Fellow of the ACM</a> and a member of the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accademia_nazionale_delle_scienze>Accademia dei XL</a>, Italy's national academy of science.
