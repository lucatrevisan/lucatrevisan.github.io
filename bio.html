<p>Luca Trevisan is 
a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at U.C. Berkeley and
a senior scientist at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing.
Luca received his Dottorato (PhD) in 1997,
from the <i>Sapienza</i> University of Rome, working with Pierluigi Crescenzi.
After graduating, Luca was a post-doc at MIT and at DIMACS, and he was
on the faculty of Columbia University, U.C. Berkeley, and Stanford, before
returning to Berkeley in 2014.


<p>Luca's research is in theoretical computer science, and most of his work has
been in two areas: (i) pseudo-randomness and its relation to average-case complexity
and derandomization; and (ii) the theory of probabilistically
checkable proofs and its relation to the approximability of combinatorial
optimization problems. Lately, he has been working on spectral graph theory and its applications to graph algorithms.</p>

<p>Luca received the <a href="http://www.sigact.org/Prizes/Student/">STOC'97
Danny Lewin (best student paper) award</a>,
the <a href="http://www.mfo.de/math-in-public/prizes/oberwolfach-prize/prizes-1/">2000
Oberwolfach Prize</a>, and
 the <a href="http://www.sloan.org/sloan-research-fellowships/">2000
Sloan Fellowship</a>.
He was an invited speaker at <a href="http://www.icm2006.org/">the 2006 International Congress of Mathematicians</a>
in Madrid. </p>
