<b>About this course</b>: a typical way to &quot;cope&quot; with the

intractability of NP-hard optimization problems is to design algorithms that

find solutions whose cost or value close to the optimum. In several interesting

cases, it is possible to prove that even finding good approximate solutions is

as hard as finding optimal solutions. Such &quot;inapproximability&quot; results

are the topic of this course. Almost all such results are proved using the PCP

Theorem (and its several variants), one of the deepest theorems in computational

complexity. We will see Irit Dinur's new proof of the PCP Theorem, how to derive

stronger variants of the PCP Theorem, and how to design reductions from PCP

Theorems to optimization problems. Typically, inapproximability results are

conditional on P!=NP, a necessary assumption since &quot;all&quot; combinatorial

optimization problems are tractable if P=NP. The theory described in this

course, however, also leads to unconditional results showing that certain

algorithms, or classes of algorithms, cannot achieve good approximations. Time

permitting, we will also see results that are conditional on the intractability

of &quot;unique games,&quot; an assumption that is conjectured to be equivalent

to P!=NP. This &quot;unique games conjecture&quot; is now the central open

question in the area.

<h2><a name="proj"></a>projects</h2>

If you are taking the course for credit, choose a project and prepare
a 35 minutes oral presentation. Presentations will be on Friday May 5
(place and time to be announced) and on Monday May 8.

<p>

You should time your presentation for 25 minutes, in order to leave
ample time for questions.

The topic for the project should be a major result on PCP or hardness
of approximation that we will not cover in the course. Some examples
are:

<ul>

<li> <b>Parallel repetition</b>. This could be a year-long project.
I recommend it only to a student interested in continuing to study
it over the summer. Here a long-term goal would be to really understand
the parallel repetition theorem and recast the proof in a different
language (possibly, coding-theoretic). For the project, the goal would
be to give an overview of the structure of the proof.<br>
Reference: Ran Raz, A Parallel Repetition Theorem.
</li>

<li><b>PCPs with short proofs</b>. This is a topic that we have
not considered at all. It would be enough to only study the
Goldreich-Sudan result, the first of the new generation of
nearly-linear length PCPs. Alternatively, the Ben Sasson-Sudan
tester for Reed-Solomon codes and its applications.<br>

</ol>
</li>

<li><b>Layered PCPs</b>. This is a way of constructing good "outer verifiers"
for covering and coloring problems. The most outstanding result proved with
this technique is a k-1 hardness result for the hitting set problem with sets
of size k.<br>
Reference: Irit Dinur, Venkatesan Guruswami, Subhash Khot, Oded Regev: A New Multilayered PCP and the Hardness of Hypergraph Vertex Cover.<br>
[Chosen by Cameron]
</li>

<li><b>Results based on unique games</b>. Unique games give an extremely
convenient outer verfied from which to start PCP constructions. It remains
an open question whether unique games capture NP-complete problems or other
problems whose intractability is a standard conjecture. Assuming the existence
of unique games for intractable problems, the construction of inner verifiers
is greatly simplified, but optimized constructions come with new, and difficult,
analytical problems to solve. The notion of <i>influence</i> of variables has
played an important role in most cases, and the KKL paper is very useful background.
The paper of Chawla et al. is an example of an important result proved using
relatively simple arguments (the proof by Khot and Vishnoi is quantitatively
preferable; the paper by Khot and Vishnoi contains as a main result an unconditional
construction. You don't need to understand the unconditional construction if you
choose that paper for the project.) The Khot-Regev paper is a bit harder to read,
but it presents another outstanding result.

<li><b>The Dinur-Safra paper</b> on vertex cover inspired the work on unique games,
introduced the idea of decoding the long code using influence, and was the force behind
the latest renaissance of PCP results. It is a long shot to read this paper in less
than a month. If you are interested, I would suggest to choose the Khot-Regev paper
as a project. Once you know Khot-Regev inside-out, try your luck with Dinur-Safra.<br>

<li><b>Hardness results for specific problems</b>. In the course, we focused on PCP results,
deriving hardness of approximation results only when relatively simple reductions would suffice.
Many fundamental results, however, require sophisticated reductions. Feige's tight
hardness result for Set Cover is an example of refined elegance. There are many other
possible results to look at. The result of Chuzhoy et al., for example, is just unbelievable.<br>
