<h1>CS 276 &mdash Projects</h1>

A final project involves the study of a paper or series of papers on 
an advanced subject not covered in class. You will write
a short report (5-10 pages), and give a 25-minute presentation 
in class. Two-people collaborations are possible, in which case the subject/papers should be more ambitious, and the presentation will be 40 minutes.
A project may be planned with a research problem in mind.

<p>

Here are some suggested topics.


<h3>Hard-core predicates</h3>

<ul>

<li>Every bit of RSA and exponentiation is hard-core<br>
<ul><li>Johan Hastad, Mats Naslund: The security of all RSA and discrete log bits. J. ACM 51(2): 187-230 (2004)</li></ul>

<li>The unified framework of Akavia, Goldwasser and Safra
<ul><li>Adi Akavia, Shafi Goldwasser, Shmuel Safra: Proving Hard-Core Predicates Using List Decoding. FOCS 2003</li></ul>

</ul>

<h3>One-way Functions and Pseudorandom Generators</h3>

<ul>

<li>Efficient "hardness amplification" for one-way permutations
<ul>
<li>Oded Goldreich, Russell Impagliazzo, Leonid A. Levin, Ramarathnam Venkatesan, David Zuckerman: Security Preserving Amplification of Hardness FOCS 1990: 318-326
<li>See also Goldreich's book
<li>A long-standing research question is whether one can do the
same for general one-way functions. It's possible that the answer
is negative for "black-box reductions."
</ul>

<li>
Pseudorandom generators from "regular" one-way functions. ("Regular
is a technical term, it means all elements of the range have the
same number of preimages.)
<ul><li>Oded Goldreich, Hugo Krawczyk, Michael Luby: On the Existence of Pseudorandom Generators. SIAM J. Comput. 22(6): 1163-1175 (1993)
<li>See also Oded Goldreich's textbook</ul>

<li>
The full HILL construction (with Holenstein's simplification). Note
that this might be too much to tackle in one month.

<ul><li>Johan Hastad, Russell Impagliazzo, Leonid A. Levin, Michael Luby: A Pseudorandom Generator from any One-way Function. SIAM J. Comput. 28(4): 1364-1396 (1999)
<li>Thomas Holenstein: Pseudorandom Generators from One-Way Functions: A Simple Construction for Any Hardness. TCC 2006: 443-461
<li>Again, it's a long-standing open question whether
a more efficient construction (one in which the seed is nearly linear
in the input length of the original one-way function) is possible. 
Maybe no such "black-box" construction is possible. Although, if you are
still reading, there is a sort of "doble-negative" result showing
that a certain style of "blak-box impossibility" argument will not work
here

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Impossibility Results</h3>

<ul>

<li> Key agreement from one-way functions. The work that
started it all
<ul><li>Russell Impagliazzo, Steven Rudich: Limits on the Provable Consequences of One-Way Permutations STOC 1989: 44-61
<li>It might be helpful to read about uniform generation with
an NP oracle, for example from
<ul><li> Mihir Bellare, Oded Goldreich, Erez Petrank:
<a href=http://eccc.hpi-web.de/eccc-reports/1998/TR98-032/index.html>Uniform Generation of NP-witnesses using an NP-oracle</a>. </ul>
The nature of the impossibility result is clarified in
<ul><li>Omer Reingold, Luca Trevisan, Salil P. Vadhan: Notions of Reducibility between Cryptographic Primitives. TCC 2004: 1-20</ul></ul>


<li> One-way permutations from one-way functions

<li>Jeff Kahn, Michael E. Saks, Clifford D. Smyth: A Dual Version of Reimer's Inequality and a Proof of Rudich's Conjecture. IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity 2000: 98-103</ul>

<li>Oblivious transfer versus public-key encryption
<ul><li>Yael Gertner, Sampath Kannan, Tal Malkin, Omer Reingold, Mahesh Viswanathan: The Relationship between Public Key Encryption and Oblivious Transfer. FOCS 2000: 325-335</ul>

<li> Trapdoor functions from public key encryption
<ul><li>Yael Gertner, Tal Malkin, Omer Reingold: On the Impossibility of Basing Trapdoor Functions on Trapdoor Predicates. FOCS 2001: 126-135</ul>

<li>A major open question is whether CCA-secure public-key encryption
can be derived in a black-box way (or in any way) from CPA-secure
public-key encryption. Currently, the partial evidence is unclear
